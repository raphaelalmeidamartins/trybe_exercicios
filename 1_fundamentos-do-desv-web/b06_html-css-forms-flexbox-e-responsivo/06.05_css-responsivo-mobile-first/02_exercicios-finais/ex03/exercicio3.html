        <p>The domestic cat[1][2] (Felis catus[2] or Felis silvestris catus[4], informally Felis domesticus[6][7]) is a
          small, usually furry, domesticated, carnivorous mammal. It is often called the housecat when kept as an indoor
          pet,[8] or simply the cat when there is no need to distinguish it from other felids and felines. Cats are
          valued by humans for companionship and ability to hunt vermin and household pests. They are primarily
          nocturnal.[9]
        </p>
        <p>Cats are similar in anatomy to the other felids, with strong, flexible bodies, quick reflexes, sharp
          retractable claws, and teeth adapted to killing small prey. As crepuscular predators, cats use their acute
          hearing and ability to see in near darkness to locate prey. Not only can cats hear sounds too faint for human
          ears, they can also hear sounds higher in frequency than humans can perceive. This is because the usual prey
          of cats (particularly rodents such as mice) make high frequency noises, so the hearing of the cat has evolved
          to pinpoint these faint high-pitched sounds. Cats also have a much better sense of smell than humans.
        </p>
        <p>Despite being solitary hunters, cats are a social species, and cat communication includes the use of a
          variety of vocalizations (meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling and grunting) as well as pheromones
          and types of cat-specific body language.[10]
